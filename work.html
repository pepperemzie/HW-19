                                We focused on redesigning the mobile format and then redesigned for desktop as well as
                                tablet versions. Our main audience was redesigning to accommodate educators' needs
                                primarily and then students/parents and donors.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-4">
                                Our main issue we wanted to address was to change Code Savvy's navigation and other
                                clarity issues causing educators and parents to miss or overlook key content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution we came up with is to redesign the navigation and content on the homepage.

                                One of the methods that helped us with the redesigning was our competitor analysis. All
                                of the competitors either offered some sort of  coding instruction or were just general
                                academic help.

                        As our team spent time observing the Code Savvy website, we discovered users are having
                        difficulty with its overall functionality. We believe these usability issues may cause parents
                        and teachers to overlook key events, programs, and resources that Code Savvy has to offer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        While brainstorming for our hypothesis, we believed that by adjusting navigation labels,
                        visuals, and overall heuristics, Code Savvy would be able to increase the number of educators
                        reaching out to Code-savvy, as well as donations and students enrolled in their coding
                        programs..

                    <p>
                        Our value proposition demonstrates Code Savvy offers  many powerful and informative services.
                        Our team had the ability to design a more user friendly website encouraging more people to get
                        involved with all the wonderful tools Code Savvy has to offer.
